  However, neither Kartik Aryan ever gave any statement on the rumors of his dating with Sara Ali Khan nor did Sara ever say anything on it. During 'No Filter Neha', when Neha asked Karthik whether he had dated any friend's couple.

  In response to this question, Karthik says, 'I have not dated two friends together. Yes, later they both became friends, so will you count it? Then I can say that I am guilty of dating two girlfriends. Apart from this he said that he is currently single and ready to love once again.

  This statement of Karthik Aryan is going viral on social media. People are linking his statement with Janhvi Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan. In the next segment of the show, Neha asks him that if you bump into your ex at a party, what questions would you ask him/her? In response to this question, Karthik says smilingly, 'I will ask him how is your present situation.'
